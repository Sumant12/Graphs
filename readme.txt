Graph:

Graph is a data structure that has the following components:
1. A set of vertices also which are called nodes.
2. A finite set of ordered pair of the form (u, v) called as edges. The pair is ordered because (u, v) is not same as (v, u) in case of directed graph. The pair of form (u, v) indicates that there is an edge from vertex u to vertex v. The edges may contain weight/value/cost.

Dijkstra Algorithm:
Dijkstra algorithm is used to calculate the shortest path from any source vertex to all the other vertexes.

My Implementation
1. Graph has been constructed using Adjacency list
2. The Dijkstra algorithm is done using priority queues using Min-heap.
